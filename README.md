# YouTube-Downloader
This is a terminal-based YouTube downloader that can download any format without limitations. You can also download an entire playlist as music files.

To use this tool, you need to provide three parameters: the playlist URL, the name of the folder where you want to save the files, and the format of the files (e.g., mp3, mp4, etc.).

Note that this tool only works for playlists, not single videos. If you want to download a single video, you can use other tools or contribute to this project by adding that feature.
